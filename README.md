# Calculator - Axure Prototype



## Overview
This is a simple calculator prototype created using Axure RP. The prototype simulates basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is designed for demonstration purposes and does not perform actual computations.

## Features
- User-friendly interface
- Interactive number buttons (0-9)
- Basic operations: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/)
- Reset/Clear functionality
- Simulated result display
- Image uploading feature for additional UI customization

## Requirements
- Axure RP (Version 9 or later recommended)
- A web browser to preview the prototype

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-calculator-axure.git
   ```
2. Open Axure RP on your computer.
3. Open the `.rp` file in Axure RP.
4. Click **Preview** to run the calculator prototype in a web browser.
5. Interact with the calculator using the buttons to see how it functions.
6. Use the **Upload Image** button to add images to customize the interface.

## How It Works
- The prototype is built using Axureâ€™s dynamic panels and interactions.
- Clicking a number button adds the digit to the display field.
- Clicking an operator button sets up the operation.
- The **Equals (=)** button simulates displaying a result.
- The **Clear (C)** button resets the input field.
- The **Upload Image** button allows users to upload and display images within the UI.
